# Car Detection Web App

Welcome to the Car Detection Web App! This Streamlit application allows you to view and interact with my AI project for detecting cars in images using YOLOv11 models.

## Overview

This app showcases different models that I have personally trained using the YOLOv11 medium-size architecture on the Stanford dataset. Each model took approximately 8 hours to train on my personal PC.

## Features

- **Upload Images**: Easily upload images in JPG, JPEG, or PNG format.
- **Model Selection**: Choose between two different YOLOv11 models for car detection.
- **Detection Results**: View the detection results with bounding boxes and confidence scores.
- **Model Information**: Get detailed information about the models used for detection.

## How to Use

1. Visit the app at [https://car-detection.streamlit.app/](https://car-detection.streamlit.app/).
2. Upload an image using the file uploader.
3. Select the model you want to use for detection.
4. View the detection results and details.

## Models

- **First model**: Trained for detecting various car models.
- **Second model**: Trained for detecting cars and motorcycles.

## Technical Details

- **YOLOv11 medium**: The YOLOv11 medium-size model was used for training.
- **Training time**: Each model took around 8 hours to train on my personal PC.
